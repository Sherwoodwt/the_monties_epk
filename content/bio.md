### The Monties

We're an indie-rock band based out of Spokane, WA. We love a bunch of music, and we're inspired by tons of different artists. Our dream is to create and release music that we love. We get really personal in the songwriting process, and we make sure it shows. We want our songs to have lasting impressions on people. We want people to connect with our music and connect with us. It's important to us that we don't disappoint our fans, and it's important to us that we keep up with them and grow with them. We want to be consistent. We think that consistent output is the most important part of what we do.
